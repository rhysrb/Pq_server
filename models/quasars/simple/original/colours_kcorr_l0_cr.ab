#AB quasar colours for the l0_cr template
#Measured from spectra provided by Paul Hewett, described in Hewett et al. (2006) & Euclid Collaboration, Barnett et al. (2019)
#Values where colour >> 5 are excluded
#Default prediction is zero flux in any bluer optical band
#Commas in column names indicate where colour can be used for different telescopes
#Colours connecting various filter sets to MKO are given
#The K-correction in the final column is suitable for the Euclid J band and is simply given by m(1450) - J (both AB)
#The model colours allow K-corrections to be determined for other systems/filters
#Column 1 = redshift
#Column 2 = z-y (LSST, Pan-STARRS)
#Column 3 = z-Y (LSST/PS - MKO)
#Column 4 = z-Y (DECam z-Y, COSMOS zpp-yhsc)
#Column 5 = z-Y (DEC,COSMOS z/zpp - MKO)
#Column 6 = z-Y (SDSS - MKO)
#Column 7 = Z-Y (MKO)
